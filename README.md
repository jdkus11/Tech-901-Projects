These are small assignments that I completed during the Tech 901 Code 1.0 class. This is a sample selection of what I accomplished in my time in the course.
These assignments are based on Harvard's CS50 curriculum. Some of the code in these files were written by the instructors. I wrote the code to implement the functions within.
